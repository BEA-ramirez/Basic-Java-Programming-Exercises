# Basic Java Programming Exercises
 This contains basic Java programming exercises.
 
 Your objective is to obtain a maximum of 50 points.
 
 Each programming exercise holds a point value as follows:
| Programming Exercise No. | Title | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Prime Numbers | 30 |
| 2 | Quarters, Dimes, and Pennies | 30 |
| 3 | Tic Tac Toe | 40 |
| 4 | Airline Seats | 40 |
| 5 | Number Counter | 30 |
| 6 | Rational Class | 70 |
| 7 | Delete Repeats | 30 |
| 8 | Time Conversion | 40 |
| 9 | Permutation Production | 60 |

The points that can be earned by the participant for each problem will be computed by the points allocated (*see table above*) divided by all the participants that has solved the problem. (e.g. *3 students solved **Rational Class** therefore, all 3 students will earn 70/3=23.33 points each*)

For every exercise number you have finished, apply for a pull request on this repository to be evaluated by the author. Counting of valid solutions and distribution of points will be presented the next meeting.

You can collaborate with your peers as long as you keep in mind that points will be divided amongst those who only apply for pull request with valid solutions.

Your score will be **Total points earned**/50.
